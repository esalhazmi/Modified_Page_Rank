# Modified_Page_Rank
A simple implementation of System call graph Extraction using modified PageRank algorithm. I followed the paper of title "Homology analysis of malware based on ensemble learning and multifeatures" published in PLOS ONE https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0211373

The calculation of TF-IDF for the system calls (vertices) is used instead of the page rank coefficient to reflect the importance degree of each vertex.

DISCLAIMER: I do not claim to be an expert in PageRank. I tried to implement and follow the approach in the paper and not sure how accurate is. I implemented it only for curiosity.
